# Fieldnotes Sprint | Jan 20, 2025
## Filling out index pages
- index pages should:
  - be in every directory
  - have links to files and subfolders in the directory
  - links should be correct and updated

See <index_audit.csv>.
The pages.md seem to be correct, so when the links in the index.md
are wrong, we should copy over the pages.md.
If the index is complete and not missing, we can delete pages.md.

See <index_fixes.csv> for tracking progress in fixing the problems identified
in the audit.
